Peer-Graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
================================================================
This code book aims to meet the evaluation criteria of the course **Getting and Ceaning Data Course Project**, from Coursera online platform, offered by Johns Hopkins University.

Selection of Files
==================
Among the files provided for the preparation of the project, it was necessary to select only those described below.

- 'README.txt'
    * Provides a brief description of the data source and the experiment
    * Informs about data usage license
    * Reports all available files
    * Informs about what was provided for each record

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features. It was read and assigned with the name **features** and the columns were named as **identifier** and **signals**

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name. It was read and assigned with the name **activities** and the columns were named as **activity** and **signals**.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set. It was read and assigned with the name **X_train**.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels. It was read and assigned with the name **y_train**.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set. It was read and assigned with the name **X_test** 

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels. It was read and assigned with the name **y_test**

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. Files used for the train data. It was read and assigned with the name **subject_train** and the column was named as **subject**

- 'train/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. Files used for the test data. It was read and assigned with the name **subject_test** and the column was named as **subject**

Data Set Information
========================
The data sets and their description were provided in the project instructions and made available through the following link:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Upon accessing this link, we identified that it is the Machine Learning Repository created by students from UCI - University of California at Irvine, Machine Learning Center and Intelligent Systems.

New Data Set
========================================
- my: stores merged y_train and y_test data sets
- mX: stores merged X_train and X_test data sets
- msubject: stores merged subject_train and subject_test data sets
- merge_dataset: stores merged my, mX and msubject. It merges the training and the test sets to create one data set **(Step 1)**
- data_tidy: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement **(Step 2)**
- second_data: Second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject **(Step 5)**
